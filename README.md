# Maze Hardware

This repository contains instructions, schematics, code and 3D models to build
hardware that can be used for animal behavior experiments.
The components have been designed for use with mice, but may be applicable
to other model systems as well.

All hardware in this repository can be easily controlled using the
[Syntalos](https://github.com/bothlab/syntalos) DAQ system.

### Available Hardware

Hardware components to build mazes.

* [Light Barrier](LightBarrier/info.md) - a simple light barrier to detect the animal's presence or actuator states.
* [Liquid Feeder](LiquidFeeder/info.md) - a very precise device to administer rewards of liquid food (e.g. condensed milk).
* [Maze Gates](MazeGates/info.md) - fast gates to open or close maze passages.
* [Sliding Gate](SlidingGate/info.md) - a sliding gate that allows precise control of the opening width.
